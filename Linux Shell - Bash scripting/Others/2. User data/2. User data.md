2. Create a script named user-data.sh that when started will ask the user for (without the a.,b.,c.):
	a.	First name
	b.	Last name
	c.	Place of birth
Then it will append the collected data to a file /tmp/user-data.dat. For example, if the user input is (without the a.,b.,c.):
	a.	John
	b.	Smith
	c.	London
The script will store John;Smith;London in the file.
